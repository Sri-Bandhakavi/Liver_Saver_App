# Liver_Saver_App

An app that returns on demand liver injury risk labels for 2335 FDA approved drugs (all small molecule drugs approved before 2018).

Liver injury risk labels returned are based on one of two sources: (1) FDA/Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base for 1035 drugs and (2) predictive model based on web-scraped real world evidence predictors from WHO/www.vigibase.org

App is based on Dash framework and can be implemented via app.py along with csv file containing all drugs/liver injury risk labels.

Code used for predictive modeling of liver injury risk labeling for 1300 drugs to be uploaded to github separately.
