# Liver_Saver_App (Insight_Summer_2019_Boston)

An app that returns on demand liver injury risk labels for 2330 FDA approved drugs (includes all small molecule drugs approved before 2018).

Liver injury risk labels returned by app are based on one of two sources: (1) FDA/Liver Toxicity Knowledge Base for 1036 drugs and (2) predictive model for 1294 drugs based on web-scraped real world evidence predictors from WHO/www.vigibase.org

App is based on Dash framework and can be implemented via running app.py along with csv file containing all drugs/liver injury risk labels.

Code used for predictive modeling of liver injury risk labeling for 1294 drugs to be uploaded separately.
